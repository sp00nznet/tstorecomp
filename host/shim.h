// Resolves the engine's Android imports against the host.
//
// Three layers, in order:
//   1. Explicit implementations -- Android-only entry points that no host
//      runtime can provide, and library bindings we link ourselves.
//   2. Name aliases -- the same function under a different name on this host
//      (POSIX `strdup` is `_strdup` in the Microsoft CRT). Only where the
//      signature is genuinely identical; a same-name-different-ABI alias is a
//      crash that looks like a game bug.
//   3. The host C runtime, looked up by name at load time. Most of the 245
//      libc and 15 libm imports are ordinary standard C that the host already
//      has, so binding them by name costs no code per symbol.
//
// Whatever none of the three answers is the hand-written work list, and
// `tsto_host` prints it.
